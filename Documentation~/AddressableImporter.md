## Setup the Importer

You should create a single AddressableImportSettings file located at `Assets/AddressableAssetsData/AddressableImportSettings.asset`. To create it, go to `Assets/AddressableAssetsData` folder, right click in your project window and choose `Create > Addressable Assets > Import Settings`.

Once the settings file selected, you can edit rules in the inspector window. Then click the `File > Save Project` to apply the changes.

## Define Rules

- `Path`, the path pattern.
- `Match Type`
  - Wildcard, `*` matches any number of characters, `?` matches a single character.
  - Regex.
- `Group Name`, leaves blank for the default group. For dynamic group see [Group Replacement](#group-replacement).
- `Label Mode`, defines if labels will be added or replaced.
- `Label Refs`, the labels to add.
- `Address Simplified`, simplify address to filename without extension.
- `Address Replacement`, leaves blank to use the asset path as address. For dynamic address see [Address Replacement](#address-replacement).

## Rule Examples

| Type     | Example                                                                         |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Wildcard | `Asset/Sprites/Icons`                                                           |
| Wildcard | `Asset/Sprites/Level??/*.asset`                                                 |
| Regex    | `^Assets/Models/.*\.fbx`                                                        |
| Regex    | `Assets/Weapons/(?<prefix>(?<category>[^/]+)/(.*/)*)(?<asset>.*_Data.*\.asset)` |

## Group Replacement

The dynamic group is supported by replacing `${name}` with the extracted value from the asset path, via the use of regex capture groups. Named capture groups can be referred to in `Group Name` via `${group}`. If groups are not named, they can be referred to numerically, via `$1`, `$2`, and so on. For more information, refer to [Microsoft Docs - Substitutions in Regular Expressions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/substitutions-in-regular-expressions). This only works for match type Regex.

For convenience, path elements can be referred via `${PATH[index]}`. This works for all match types.

| Asset Path               | Path                                          | Group Name               | Result         |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| `Assets/Sprites/cat.png` | `Assets/Sprites/*.png`                        | `${PATH[1]}`             | Sprites        |
| `Assets/Sprites/cat.png` | `Assets/Sprites/*.png`                        | `${PATH[-1]}`            | Sprites        |
| `Assets/Sprites/cat.png` | `Assets/Sprites/*.png`                        | `${PATH[1]}-Group`       | Sprites-Group  |
| `Assets/Sprites/cat.png` | `Assets/Sprites/*.png`                        | `${PATH[0]}-${PATH[1]}`  | Assets-Sprites |
| `Assets/cat/cat01.png`   | `Assets/(?<category>[^/]+)/(?<asset>.*)\.png` | `${PATH[0]}:${category}` | Assets:cat     |

## Address Replacement

Similar to [Group Replacement](#group-replacement), address replacement is also supported.

| Asset Path             | Path                                          | Address Replacement               | Result           |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------|
| `Assets/cat/cat01.png` | `Assets/(?<category>[^/]+)/(?<asset>.*)\.png` | `${category}-${asset}`            | cat-cat01        |
| `Assets/cat/cat01.png` | `Assets/(?<category>[^/]+)/(?<asset>.*)\.png` | `${PATH[0]}:${category}-${asset}` | Assets:cat-cat01 |

The importer always overrides existing address if
- The address looks like a path (starts with `Assets/`).
- `Address Simplified` is ticked.
- `Address Replacement` is in use.

In another word, if you are intending to manually change the address later, leave `Address Simplified` unticked, `Address Replacement` blank, and do not use `Assets/` prefix for the customized address name.

## Label Replacement

The importer always overrides existing labels if `LabelMode = Replace`.

## Quick assets (re)import

The importer should apply the rules whenever an asset being imported, moved, or deleted. However, if you modified rules or want to apply rules to existing assets, you need to manually apply the rules. To quickly apply the rules, select target folder(s) in the project view, right-click to open the context menu, and then click `AddressablesImporter: Check Folder(s)`. The action is more efficient than force reimport assets.

## About prefab mode

When both prefab mode (the preview scene for editing a prefab) and the autosave feature are enabled, every modification will cause the asset to be saved and trigger the importer, leads to slow response. For performance reasons, the importer will ignore the current editing asset.
